# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Intermediate Project
A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details like income, credit history, employment status, and more. This model helps financial institutions automate and speed up the loan approval process with higher accuracy.

In this project, we primarily used the Logistic Regression algorithm, which is widely used for binary classification problems like loan approval. Logistic Regression provides a probabilistic framework to predict the likelihood of a loan being approved (Y) or rejected (N).
